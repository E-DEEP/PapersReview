Stance Detection : automatically identifying **positions** on a specific topic in text
- TWO apporaches to stance detection
  - 1. topic-specific stance
    - requires the existence of numerous, well-labeled training examples
  - 2. cross-target stance
    -  does not require training examples for a new topic, it does require human knowledge about any new topic and how it is related to the training topics

* Main Contribution
  - release a new dataset (for zero-shot stance detection) `VAST`
  - new model :  implicitly captures relationships between topics using generalized topic representations
    - based on TGA(Topic-Grouped Attention)
    - contextual conditional encoding layer
    - generalized topic representation(GTR)
- Future Work
  - additional methods to represent and use generalized topic information (e.g., topic modeling)
