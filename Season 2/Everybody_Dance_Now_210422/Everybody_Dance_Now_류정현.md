##### video-to-video translation (pose-to-appearance mapping)
##### 1) predict two consecutive frames for temporally coherent video results
##### 2) introduce a separate pipeline for realistic face synthesis

##### * the target person never performed the same exact sequence of motions as the source
##### - target : whose appearance we wish to synthesize
##### - source : whose motion we wish to impose onto target person

##### frame-by-frame manner (i.e. discover an image-to-image translation between the source&target)
##### use "pose stick figures"


## 3. METHOD
### 1) pose detection
##### use pre-trained pose detector P (estimates 2D x,y) and create pose stick figure
### 2) global pose normalization
##### need to transform keyporints of the source person so that they appear in accordance wuth the target person's bosy shape and location
##### find trasfromation by analyzing heights and ankle positions
### 3) mapping from normalized pose stick fuigures to the target subject
