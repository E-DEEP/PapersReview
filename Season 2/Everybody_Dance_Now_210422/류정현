### video-to-video translation (pose-to-appearance mapping)
### 1) predict two consecutive frames for temporally coherent video results
### 2) introduce a separate pipeline for realistic face synthesis

### * the target person never performed the same exact sequence of motions as the source
### - target : whose appearance we wish to synthesize
### - source : whose motion we wish to impose onto target person

### frame-by-frame manner (i.e. discover an image-to-image translation between the source&target)
### use "pose stick figures"
