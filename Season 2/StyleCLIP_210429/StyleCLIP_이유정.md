1. introduce an optimization scheme that utilizes a CLIP-based loss to modify an input latent vector in response to a user-provided text prompt.
2. describe a latent mapper that infers a text-guided latent manipulation step for a given input image, allowing faster and more stable text-based manipulation.
3. present a method for mapping a text prompts to input-agnostic directions in Style-GAN's style space, enabling interactive text-driven image manipulation.
