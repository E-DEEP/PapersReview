# ProDA: Prototypical Pseudo Label Denoising and Target Structure Learning for Domain Adaptive Semantic Segmentation
## Problem of self-training
1. Pseudo labels are noisy
2. The target features are dispersed due to the discrepancy between source and target domains.
## Idea
- focus on Representative prototypes, the feature centroids of classes
- Exploit the feature distances from prototypes that provide richer information than mere prototypes
    - Estimate the likelihood of pseudo labels to **facilitate online correction** in the course of training
    - rectify the pseudo labels by estimating the class-wise likelihoods according to its relative feature dis- tances to all class prototypes
    -  propose to align soft pro- totypical assignments for different views of the same target, which produces a more compact target feature space.
- Distilling the already learned knowledge to a self-supervised pertained model further boosts the performance
